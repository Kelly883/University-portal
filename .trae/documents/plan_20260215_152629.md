# Deployment Fix Plan: Import Path Errors

## 1. Analysis
*   **Error**: `Type error: Cannot find module '@/components/ui/card'` (and likely `table` as well).
*   **Cause**: The build server is failing to resolve the alias `@/components/ui/card`. This usually happens when:
    *   The file casing on the filesystem (e.g., `Card.tsx`) doesn't match the import (`card`). Windows is case-insensitive, but Linux (build server) is case-sensitive.
    *   I previously created files like `src/components/ui/card.tsx` (lowercase), so the import *should* work if the casing matches exactly.
    *   *Self-Correction*: Wait, I created them as `src/components/ui/card.tsx`. Let me verify if I accidentally capitalized them in the file creation step or if `tsconfig.json` paths are misconfigured.
    *   *Alternative Cause*: `tsconfig.json` might not have the correct `baseUrl` or `paths` configuration to map `@/*` to `./src/*`.

## 2. Investigation (Read-Only)
*   Check `tsconfig.json` to verify `paths` configuration.
*   Check the actual file names in `src/components/ui`.

## 3. Solution Strategy
*   **If `tsconfig.json` is missing paths**: Add `"paths": { "@/*": ["./src/*"] }`.
*   **If casing is mismatched**: Rename files to match imports (or vice versa). I prefer lowercase filenames (`card.tsx`) for components in Next.js projects usually, but standard React convention is PascalCase (`Card.tsx`). I previously wrote `card.tsx`, so the import `@/components/ui/card` is correct *if* the file is indeed lowercase.
*   **Action**: I will assume the `tsconfig.json` needs verification or the file structure needs to be confirmed.

## 4. Execution Steps
1.  **Read `tsconfig.json`**: Confirm `@` alias setup.
2.  **List Files**: Check `src/components/ui` to see if files exist and their casing.
3.  **Fix**:
    *   Update `tsconfig.json` if needed.
    *   Or rename files if casing is wrong.
    *   Or fix imports if they are wrong.

*Hypothesis*: I suspect `tsconfig.json` might be missing the path alias or pointing to the wrong root since this is a fresh project structure.
