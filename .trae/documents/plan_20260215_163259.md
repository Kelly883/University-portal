# Deployment Fix Plan: Auth Handlers Export

## 1. Analysis
*   **Error**: `Type error: Module '"@/auth"' has no exported member 'handlers'.`
*   **Context**:
    *   In `src/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts`, I am trying to import `handlers` from `@/auth`.
    *   However, checking `src/auth.ts`, I see that I destructured the return of `NextAuth(...)` and exported `GET`, `POST`, `auth`, `signIn`, and `signOut` individually.
    *   I did **NOT** export the `handlers` object itself.

## 2. Solution Strategy
I need to align the export in `src/auth.ts` with the import in the route handler.

### Option A: Export `handlers` in `src/auth.ts`
Modify `src/auth.ts` to export the `handlers` object directly.

```typescript
export const {
  handlers, // <--- Add this
  auth,
  signIn,
  signOut,
} = NextAuth({ ... })
```

### Option B: Import `GET` and `POST` directly in `route.ts`
Since `src/auth.ts` already exports `GET` and `POST` (which are destructured from `handlers`), I can just import them directly in the route handler instead of importing `handlers` and then destructuring again.

**Preferred Approach**: **Option B**. It's cleaner and uses the existing exports.

## 3. Execution Steps
1.  **Modify `src/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts`**:
    *   Change: `import { handlers } from "@/auth"; export const { GET, POST } = handlers;`
    *   To: `export { GET, POST } from "@/auth";`

## 4. Refinement
This is a one-line fix that leverages the existing exports from `src/auth.ts`.
