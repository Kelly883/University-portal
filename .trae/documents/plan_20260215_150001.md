# Git Push Plan

## 1. Status Check
*   **Goal**: Check if there are any uncommitted changes in the local repository.
*   **Command**: `git status`

## 2. Action
*   **Scenario A (Clean)**: If the working tree is clean, I will inform you that everything is already up to date with GitHub.
*   **Scenario B (Dirty)**: If there are uncommitted changes, I will:
    1.  Stage all changes (`git add .`).
    2.  Commit them with a descriptive message (e.g., "WIP: Save current progress").
    3.  Push to `origin main`.

## 3. Execution
I will proceed to check the status and push if necessary.
