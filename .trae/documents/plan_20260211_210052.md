# Troubleshoot Git Push & Vercel Sync

## 1. Verify Git Remote Status
- **Issue**: The user reports Vercel isn't seeing the push. This likely means the push didn't actually reach the `origin/main` branch, or Vercel is connected to a different repo/branch.
- **Action**:
    - Run `git status` to ensure the working directory is clean.
    - Run `git log -1` to confirm the latest commit ("Configure for Vercel deployment...") is at the tip of `main`.
    - Run `git push origin main` again to ensure everything is synced.

## 2. Force a New Commit (Trigger)
- **Action**: Make a small, harmless change (e.g., whitespace in `README.md` or updating `vercel.json` as planned) to create a fresh commit hash.
- **Reason**: Sometimes Vercel hooks might miss a push; a new commit triggers a new build.

## 3. Apply Vercel Configuration Fixes
- **Action**: Apply the simplified `vercel.json` (removing `config` block) as previously planned. This serves a dual purpose: fixing the potential 404 cause and creating a new commit to trigger Vercel.

## 4. Push & Verify
- **Action**:
    - `git add .`
    - `git commit -m "Fix: Simplify vercel.json and trigger deployment"`
    - `git push origin main`
- **Verification**: Provide the user with the latest commit hash to compare with their Vercel dashboard.

## Checkpoint
- If `git push` says "Everything up-to-date" but Vercel still doesn't see it, we will verify the remote URL (`git remote -v`).
