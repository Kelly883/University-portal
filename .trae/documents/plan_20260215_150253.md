# UI Component Library & Layout Plan

## 1. Analysis
*   **Goal**: Create a robust set of reusable UI components and a base layout for the dashboards (Admin, Faculty, Student) using Tailwind CSS.
*   **Design System**:
    *   Colors: Primary (`#2D3436`), Accent (`#1B263B`), Gold (`#C5A059`).
    *   Fonts: Inter, Barlow Condensed.
    *   Icons: Lucide-React (installed) or Material Symbols (already configured). I'll stick to Lucide for consistency in React components if possible, or Material Symbols if preferred by the user's previous design. *Decision: Use Lucide-React for better SVG integration in Next.js.*

## 2. Component Architecture (`src/components/ui`)
I will create the following atomic components:
*   **Button**: Variants (primary, secondary, outline, ghost), Sizes (sm, md, lg).
*   **Input**: Text, password, email with validation states.
*   **Card**: Header, Content, Footer structure.
*   **Table**: Responsive data table with stripe/hover states.
*   **Modal**: Dialog overlay with animations.
*   **Badge/Toast**: Status indicators and notifications.

## 3. Layout Architecture (`src/components/layout`)
*   **Sidebar**:
    *   Role-aware: Renders different links based on `user.role` (Admin, Faculty, Student).
    *   Collapsible state (mobile-friendly).
*   **Navbar**:
    *   User profile dropdown (Avatar, Sign out).
    *   Breadcrumbs or Page Title.
*   **DashboardLayout**:
    *   Combines Sidebar + Navbar + Main Content Area.
    *   `src/app/(dashboard)/layout.tsx` will be updated to use this.

## 4. Implementation Strategy
1.  **Scaffold Directories**: Create `src/components/ui` and `src/components/layout`.
2.  **Build Atoms**: Implement Button, Input, Card.
3.  **Build Molecules**: Implement Sidebar (with navigation config), Navbar.
4.  **Build Layout**: Assemble `DashboardLayout`.
5.  **Refactor**: Update existing dashboard pages to use these new layouts.

## 5. Execution Steps
1.  **Create Components**: `Button.tsx`, `Input.tsx`, `Card.tsx`, `Table.tsx`.
2.  **Create Navigation**: `Sidebar.tsx`, `Navbar.tsx`.
3.  **Update App Layout**: Refactor `src/app/(dashboard)/layout.tsx`.
4.  **Verify**: Check Admin/Faculty/Student dashboards visually.

*Self-Correction*: The user asked for `layouts/` folder, but in Next.js App Router, layouts are usually file-based (`layout.tsx`). However, I will create a `src/components/layouts/` folder for the *component* logic to keep it clean as requested.
