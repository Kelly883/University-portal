# Deployment Fix: Root Directory Configuration

## 1. Issue Analysis
- **Error**: "Railpack could not determine how to build the app." / "Script start.sh not found"
- **Context**: This typically happens when deploying to a platform (like Railway or Vercel) where the build system expects the application code to be in the root directory, but our Next.js app is nested inside `next_app/`.
- **Diagnosis**: The deployment platform is looking at the repository root (`titan university/`) which contains `legacy_django/`, `next_app/`, and `README.md`, but no `package.json` or build script in the root itself.

## 2. Solution Strategy
We have two main options:
- **Option A (Recommended for Vercel)**: Configure the "Root Directory" setting in the deployment platform to point to `next_app`.
- **Option B (Universal/Repo Structure)**: Move the Next.js app to the root of the repository and move `legacy_django` to a separate folder or keep it as is.

Given the user is likely deploying to Vercel (mentioned earlier) or a similar PaaS (Railway based on "Railpack"), and we want a clean repo structure:

**Plan: Configure Root Directory (No Code Changes Required, but we will add a vercel.json for safety)**

However, since "Railpack" suggests Railway, we might need a `nixpacks.toml` or just ensure the platform knows where the app is.

**Refined Plan: Move Next.js to Root**
To ensure compatibility with *any* deployment platform without complex config:
1.  Move contents of `next_app/` to the root directory.
2.  Ensure `legacy_django/` remains as a subdirectory.
3.  Update `package.json` and config files if necessary (paths are usually relative so should be fine).

## 3. Execution Steps
1.  **Move Files**: Move all files from `next_app/*` to `./`.
2.  **Clean Up**: Remove the empty `next_app/` directory.
3.  **Verify**: Check `package.json` is in the root.
4.  **Push**: Commit and push changes.

This is the most robust fix. It makes the repo a standard Next.js repo with a legacy folder, rather than a monorepo-like structure that requires specific build args.

## 4. Alternative (If user prefers keeping folders)
If we must keep `next_app/`, we would create a `vercel.json` or `railway.toml` in the root pointing to it. But moving to root is standard.

**Decision**: Move Next.js to root.
