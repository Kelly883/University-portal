# University Portal System Implementation Plan

## 1. Project Initialization & Configuration
- **Objective**: Set up the Django project with PostgreSQL and essential dependencies.
- **Steps**:
    1. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies (`django`, `psycopg2-binary`, `pillow`, etc.).
    2. Start a new Django project `university_portal`.
    3. Configure `settings.py` for PostgreSQL database connection.
    4. Configure static and media file handling.
    5. Create a `requirements.txt` file.

## 2. Database Modeling (Core & Modules)
- **Objective**: Define the data structure for all requested modules.
- **Apps & Models**:
    - **`accounts` App**:
        - `User`: Custom user model inheriting from `AbstractUser` with `role` field (Admin, Faculty, Student, Parent).
        - `Profile`: Extended profile information (phone, address, etc.).
    - **`academic` App**:
        - `Department`: Name, Description.
        - `Course`: Name, Code, Department, Faculty (ForeignKey), Credits.
        - `Enrollment`: Student (ForeignKey), Course (ForeignKey), Status, Date.
        - `CourseMaterial`: File upload (PDF/Video), Course (ForeignKey).
    - **`attendance` App**:
        - `Attendance`: Course, Student, Date, Status (Present/Absent/Late).
    - **`exams` App**:
        - `Exam`: Course, Title, Date, Max Score.
        - `Result`: Exam, Student, Score, Grade.
    - **`notifications` App**:
        - `Notification`: Recipient, Title, Message, Read Status, Created At.

## 3. Authentication & Authorization
- **Objective**: Secure the system with role-based access.
- **Features**:
    - Login/Logout/Password Reset views.
    - Custom Decorators/Mixins for Role-based access (`@student_required`, `@faculty_required`, `@admin_required`).
    - Email verification stub (or console backend for development).

## 4. Frontend Development (Django Templates + Bootstrap 5)
- **Objective**: Create a responsive, modern UI.
- **Structure**:
    - `base.html`: Main layout with responsive navigation bar (context-aware based on user role).
    - **Dashboards**:
        - `admin_dashboard.html`: Stats, quick links to management.
        - `faculty_dashboard.html`: Assigned courses, upcoming exams.
        - `student_dashboard.html`: Enrolled courses, attendance, grades.
    - **Module Views**: Lists and Forms for managing resources.

## 5. Core Functionality Implementation
- **Admin Module**:
    - CRUD views for Users, Departments, Courses.
    - Enrollment management (Approve/Reject).
    - Analytics view (aggregations).
- **Faculty Module**:
    - "My Courses" view.
    - Upload Material form.
    - Mark Attendance interface (bulk update or list view).
    - Exam creation and Grade entry.
- **Student Module**:
    - Course browsing and enrollment.
    - View Grades/Results.
    - View Attendance history.
- **Notifications**:
    - In-app notification bell/list.
    - Signal handlers to trigger notifications on events (e.g., new exam, grade posted).

## 6. Security & Final Polish
- **Security**: Ensure CSRF protection is active (default in Django), password hashing (default), and permission checks on every view.
- **Testing**: Verify flows for each role.
- **Documentation**: Create a README with setup instructions.

## Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Python, Django
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Frontend**: Django Templates, Bootstrap 5 (CDN), CSS
- **Authentication**: Django Auth System
