# Deployment Fix Plan: Import Path Errors (Part 2)

## 1. Analysis
*   **Error**: `Type error: Cannot find module '@/lib/prisma'` (in `src/app/(dashboard)/admin/courses/page.tsx`).
*   **Cause**:
    *   Previously, the `lib` folder was in the root (`./lib/prisma.ts`).
    *   My updated `tsconfig.json` now points `@/*` to `./src/*`.
    *   This means `@/lib/prisma` is looking for `./src/lib/prisma.ts`.
    *   However, if `prisma.ts` is still in the root `lib` folder (not `src/lib`), the import will fail.
    *   OR, if I moved `lib` to `src/lib`, but the file is named `prisma.ts` and I'm importing `prisma` (which should work), maybe it's missing.

## 2. Investigation
*   Check where `prisma.ts` is located.
*   If it's in the root `./lib`, I need to move it to `./src/lib` to match the new architecture and `tsconfig` paths.

## 3. Solution Strategy
*   **Move `lib` to `src`**: Consolidate all source code into `src` for consistency.
*   **Verify `auth.ts`**: Since `auth.ts` is in the root (usually), it imports `prisma`. If I move `prisma`, I need to update imports in `auth.ts` too.
*   *Alternative*: Keep `lib` in root and add a path alias for it. But moving to `src` is cleaner for Next.js 14+ projects.

## 4. Execution Steps
1.  **Locate `prisma.ts`**: Check if it's in `lib` or `src/lib`.
2.  **Move/Create**: Move `lib` folder into `src` if it's outside.
3.  **Update Imports**: Check `auth.ts` and `auth.config.ts` if they reference the old location.

*Hypothesis*: `prisma.ts` is likely in `root/lib/prisma.ts`, but `tsconfig` says `@/` -> `src/`. So `@/lib/prisma` looks for `src/lib/prisma`.
